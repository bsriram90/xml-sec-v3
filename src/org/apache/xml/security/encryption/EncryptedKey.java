 * The <code>EncryptedKey</code> element is used to transport encryption keys

 * XML document, be placed within an application document, or appear inside an
 * <code>EncryptedData</code> element as a child of a <code>ds:KeyInfo</code>
 * element. The key value is always encrypted to the recipient(s). When
 * <code>EncryptedKey</code> is decrypted the resulting octets are made
 * available to the <code>EncryptionMethod</code> algorithm without any
 * additional processing.
